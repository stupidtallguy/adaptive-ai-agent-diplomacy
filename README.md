This repository contains the implementation and analysis of advanced AI agent design for dynamic and partially observable environments, developed as part of the Spring 2025 Artificial Intelligence course at Shiraz University.

🛰️ Part 1 – Adaptive Drone Agent

Hybrid goal- and utility-based agent

Operates in a dynamic 15×15 terrain with hazards, fuel constraints, and partial observability

Implements state-space modeling, dynamic replanning, heuristic-guided A*, UCS, and Greedy search

Visual logging, animation with matplotlib, and heuristic heatmaps

🕊️ Part 2 – Strategic Diplomacy AI

CSP-based Scheduling for multi-faction negotiations under complex constraints

Supports dynamic failures (e.g., room destruction) with localized repair

Adversarial Negotiation Simulator using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning with evaluation metrics (trust, fatigue, time bias)

Includes logging, visualizations, performance comparisons, and complete simulation traces.
